zipit_hud
=========

Now playing for Zipit Z2 and hgd.
This is intended to run within a GTK desktop environment on the Zipit. I used Debian.

To build this you will need to have Lazarus 0.9.30.4 and need to have hgdc-x checked out into the same directory, as this project uses the hgd client implementation from that.

The build environment will need to be set up for arm cross-compilation, which wasn't simple to do, and the project settings here are still hard-coded to my development environment.

There are build modes for desktop deployment for testing.
